# How It Works:
- Session Saving: The discord APIs automatically saves the session into a file 
- When you run the script again, it won't ask you to log in if the session is still valid.
- Login: The script starts by logging in your session. If the session is already saved, it skips this step.
- Sending Messages: It reads a file (users.txt) containingdiscord users' IDs and sends a message to each one.

# Notes
Ensure that the users.txt file is in the same directory as the script or provide an absolute path.
For sending messages to DISCORD USERS, ensure they are in your DISCORD SERVER.
