# How It Works:
- Session Saving: The discord APIs automatically saves the session into a file 
- When you run the script again, it won't ask you to log in if the session is still valid.
- Login: The script starts by logging in your session. If the session is already saved, it skips this step.
- Sending Messages: It reads a file (users.txt) containingdiscord users' IDs and sends a message to each one.
